abstract = "The forest–steppe ecotone in Argentine Patagonia has been planted with non-native Pinus ponderosa, Pseudotsuga menziesii, Pinus radiata, and P. contorta. As in many other planted areas of the Southern Hemisphere, there is great concern about increasing landscape flammability. We determined, under lab conditions, live fuel moisture content (LFMC) and leaf ignition of these conifers, a naturalized poplar, and 13 native species. The mean LFMC was inversely related to leaf ignition of these species. The conifer LFMC was lower than that of most natives, making the conifers the most ignitable species. Pinus ponderosa and Pseudotsuga menziesii showed the spring dip phenomenon (i.e., low LFMC in early spring). Leaf ignition and LFMC may help elucidate some flammability components at species levels. At landscape scales, however, they have to be evaluated along with other landscape traits such as structure and stand composition. Understanding this landscape context will require full-scale experimental fires. Nevertheless, our results provide useful information for fire danger assessment, and also for setting policies aimed at planning and applying appropriate silvicultural techniques for fire prevention and control, and hence reducing fire danger at stand or landscape levels."
abstract_short = "Our lab results showed that live fuel moisture content (LFMC) is lower, and leaf ignition higher in exotic conifers than in most native species in Patagonia. Populus nigra showed the lowest leaf ignition parameters. Besides, Pinus ponderosa and Pseudotsuga menziesii, have extremely low LFMC in early spring (spring dip), when the wildland fire control system is not yet fully operational. These results are useful for understanding flammability of individual plants and can also be used as inputs for fire behavior models. However, they cannot be directly used as a surrogate for determining landscape flammability. In addition, leaf and canopy traits, stand density, and fuel distribution, among others characteristics, should be considered. For reducing fire risk posed by conifer afforestations, initial diminution of plantation density, reductions in density, and elevation of canopy height of old plantations, accompanied by prescribed burning and other slash treatments, and establishing lines of Populus nigra poplar within conifer stands seems to be the best solution. These findings should promote further research into silvicultural techniques to reduce fire risk in Patagonian afforestations. Rangers, foresters, and policymakers should use this basic information for planning conifer planting and management schemes aimed at reducing landscape flammability"

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
# summary = "A mobile visual clothing search system is presented whereby a smart phone user can either choose a social networking image or capture a new photo of a person wearing clothing of interest and search for similar clothing in a large cloud-based ecommerce database. The phone's GPS location is used to re-rank results by retail store location, to inform the user of local stores where similar clothing items can be tried on."
